# Team Handbook
## Cohort
### Team Goal
Build a functional, full-stack app that looks good and delivers value to end users.  
Doesn't have to be fully featured, an MVP that can go live is fine.  

### Tech Stack
- React + Redux + React-Router
- Express + Node
- PostgreSQL

### Coding Style
- AirBnb Style Guide

### Weekly Review Day & Time
Saturdays at 7PM (8PM for Philosocode & Roo)

### Weekly Chingu Checkin
Alternate among users (decide during Weekly Review)

### Task Management
Try Asana for now. If it doesn't work out, try ZenHub + Google Calendars

### Weekly Meeting Flow
Review previous sprint -> prepare for upcoming sprint -> do weekly review


## Team Conventions
### React Component Names
File names should be in PascalCase (e.g. MyComponent), where the first letter of each word is capitalized.
Exported components should also be named this way.

## Git Workflow
**If you need help with something, ask! Git can be confusing**  

### General
- Clone the project
- Branch Headers:
  + bug/fix-header
  + feature/add-task
  + refactor/clean-up-footer
  + style/colour-the-navbar

### Before you start coding...
- pull changes before starting to work
- commit often. Each commit should have 1 clear purpose (single responsibility principle)

### I want to work on something! What do I do?
Create a new feature branch (refer to above: bug, feature, refactor, style)

## Merging
### I'm done working on a feature. I want to merge it now!
Create a pull request for the `dev` branch.

### Okay, but how do I make a pull request?
- make sure you've pushed your changes in your feature branch
- on GitHub, click "New Pull Request"
  + Base: dev
  + Compare: feature branch
- add 1 or more reviewers
- assign to the person making the request

### We should move code from `dev` to `master`
Once a group of features are ready:
- thoroughly test to make sure they work
  + check edge cases
- after, create a pull request to master

### What if there's a merge conflict?
Discuss it with relevant team member. Communication is key!

- [ ] Get everyone's thoughts. Listen to all sides
- [ ] Learn to concede when things don't go your/our way
- [ ] If all else fails, majority vote

### Absent Members
